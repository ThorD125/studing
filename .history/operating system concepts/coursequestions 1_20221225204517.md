# Course Questions - Lecture 1

## What does it truly mean if people say: "computers work on 0's and 1's"?

What is a "framework"?
> its a frame for building software on top and it will call our code

What is a "library"?
> is a collection of code that can be used by other code and we cal it

What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
> compiles the code and interpreter interprets the code
> every time you run an interpret language it needs to "recalculate" the code and compile it
> while if it is compiled it will be compiled once and then it will be run and we can run it over and over

What type of programming languages exist? Why are some called highand others low-level programming languages?
> high level languages are easier to understand and low level languages are harder to understand

What is the difference between assembly code and machine code? What is disassembly in this context?
> machine language are 0 and 1 and assembly code is a language that is closer to the machine language

What is a PCB (in a hardware context) and how are electronics and logical gates related?
> PCB is a printed circuit board and it is a board that has all the components of the computer and it is connected to the motherboard

## Give 5 names of different Operating Systems (flavors)

Which families are still common today / most used?
> windows, linux, mac, android, ios

How old are they?
> 30, 30,20, 14, 15

What is a Linux distribution?
> its a flaver of linux
> in linux there are multiple specific destributions
> each of these has its own + and - points but they are all based on the same kernel

## Give a definition for "Operating System" (in a classic sense and as defined in this course)

-- Informal definition
A device that only translates a basic input in one action has/is no OS. If there is some sort of managing by itself or it acts as something between the user and the device (hardware) we can speak about an operating system.
-- Formal definition
“There is a body of software, in fact, that is responsible for making it easy to run programs (even allowing you to seemingly run many at the same time), allowing programs to share memory, enabling programs to interact with devices, and other fun stuff like that. That body of software is called the operating system (OS), as it is in charge of making sure the system operates correctly and efficiently in an easy-to-use manner.”

Do a microwave, a fridge or a classic Game Boy have operating systems? (Note: we are not talking about smart fridges or microwaves ;)
> nope bcs they only take basic input and they only do one thing

Explain the difference between virtualisation, emulation and simulation?
> virtualization is faking a machine and its hardware directly accesses its host hardware
> virtualization only allows software that already can run on a thing to run on its software
> while emulations allows software that cant run on other hardware to run on its software
> simulation is a model of a real system that is used to test the real system

What is a mainframe?
> a mainframe is a computer that is used by a lot of people at the same time

What is/are the primary goal(s) of an Operating System?
> to make the computer easier to use

## Why is there a new way of looking at "Operating Systems" (in a cloud / micro service / more modern sense)?

> because we have more and more devices and we need to manage them

## Explain the difference between User space and Kernel space

> most things run in the user space and the kernel space is the part of the OS that is responsible for the hardware
> its split into sections so faulty programs cant damage the kernel

## What are system calls?

> system calls are the way that the user space can communicate with the kernel space

## What are drivers?

> drivers are the way that the kernel space can communicate with the hardware

## General Computer History (up to present day)

What made Pascal so special ?
>
Why are people like Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace so critical in the evolution of (modern) computers ?
> if they didnt invent their part computers we know today wouldnt exist
Was there ever such a thing as a non-electronic computer ?
> yes a mechanical one
How did Alan Turing win the war ?
> he cracked enigma
Which functions does a punch card have for a computer ?
> a set of instructions
What do we mean when we talk about the Von Neumann bottleneck ?
> computors have a bottleneck bcs the speed of processing is slower than the speed of memory
How does Moore's Law impact your cost of digital living ?
> it makes it cheaper bcs every 2 years computes get 2 times faster

## A Matter of Unix

Why was Unix made at all ?
> it was a way to combine kernel programs etc to make the development of new programs easier
Why was Dennis Ritchie a crucial element in the evolution of the computer ?
> c, linux
Who was Ken Thompson ?
> unix, b, go, utf8
What was the role of the evolution of B & C in the creation of Unix and subsequent Operating Systems ?
> it assembled the kernel
What are the core principles of the Unix Philosophy ?
> make each program do one thing well
Why is worse (sometimes) better in modern operating systems ?
> because it makes it easier to use
Sketch the three main family lines that evolved from Unix
> GNU, BSD, SRVS
What is POSIX ?
> portable operating system interface
What is UTF 32-16-8 ?
> a way to encode characters
What's GNU ?
> a license that allows you to use and modify the code and redistribute it as long as you dont remove the license
What is a distro ?
>
How do you find out wich distros are most used and why would you want to know ?
>
