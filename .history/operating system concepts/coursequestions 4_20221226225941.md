# Course Questions - Lecture 4

What is deadlocking?
> Deadlocking is a situation where two or more processes are waiting for each other to finish a task.
Who was Dijkstra?
> Dijkstra was a Dutch computer scientist who invented the concept of deadlocking.
What are the 4 deadlock conditions?
> Mutual exclusion: “only one process at a time can use the resource”
> Hold and wait: “A process must be holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire additional resources that are being held by other processes”
> No preemption: see CPU scheduling
> Circular wait: Cycle
What is the difference between deadlock avoidance & deadlock prevention?
> prevention is making sure 1 of the 4 conditions is not met, avoidance is detecting if a deadlock is about to happen and preventing it.
What are safe sequences and why are they interesting?
> A safe sequence is a sequence of processes that can be executed without causing a deadlock. They are interesting because they can be used to prevent deadlocks.
What is the concept of virtual memory?
> its a technique to use secondary memory as part of the main memory.
What is the difference between the difference layer caches (1,2,3)?
> speed
What is the difference between an executable and a process?
> an executable is a file that contains the instructions for a program, a process is a running program.
What is "swapping"?
> swapping is when a process is moved from main memory to secondary memory.
What is partitioning, paging, segmentation in the context of memory layout strategy's. Are they consecutive memory allocation or non-consecutive?
> partitioning is dividing the memory into partitions, paging is dividing the memory into pages, segmentation is dividing the memory into segments. They are non-consecutive.
What is trashing?
> trashing is when a process is moved from secondary memory to main memory.
What is the difference between a page and a frame?
> a page is a part of a process, a frame is a part of the memory.
What is the copy-on-write principle?
>
