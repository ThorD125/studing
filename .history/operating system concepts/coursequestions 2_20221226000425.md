## What is the workflow (--> you should be able to do this yourself!) to properly deploy/ship/package an application

- Create an application that prints "hello world" in a programming language.
- Create a Dockerfile for this application
- Build a Docker image from this Dockerfile
- Create and run a Docker container from this Docker image
- Interact with the container by entering (and gaining access with for example a shell) to the running Docker container
- Stop and remove the Docker container.
