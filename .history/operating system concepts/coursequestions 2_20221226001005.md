# Course Questions - Lecture 2

## What are containers?

> they are isolated processes

## Why would anyone use containers? Aka. what is the prime goal/function of containers?

> it is a way to isolate processes, so that they can run on the same machine without interfering with each other

## What is the difference between a container and a virtual machine?

> a virtual machine is a full operating system, a container is just a process

## Why are the terms "container" and "docker" not synonyms?

> docker is a company that makes a container technology

## List 2 other technologies to run a "container" without using "docker"

> lxd, containerd

## Is it possible to run the very same type of Docker container both on Linux and on Windows? Why or why not? How do Windows 10 and Windows 11 work around this?

> yis it is possible because docker is a container technology, not a linux technology

## What is the difference between the Docker client (utilities) and the Docker server (~daemon)?

> the docker client is the command line interface, the docker server is the daemon that runs in the background

## What is a Dockerfile?

> a dockerfile is a file that contains instructions on how to build a docker image

## What is a Docker image?

> a docker image is a file that contains the instructions on how to build a docker container

## What is a Docker registry?

> a docker registry is a place where you can store docker images

## What do the following docker commands do?


- `docker ps`
> shows all running containers
- `docker images`
> shows all images
- `docker run -d <imagename>`
> runs a container in the background
- `docker exec -it <imagename> sh`
> runs a shell in the container
- `docker compose up`
> runs a docker-compose file
- `docker stop <containerid>`
>
- `docker rm <containerid>`
>

## What is the workflow (--> you should be able to do this yourself!) to properly deploy/ship/package an application

- Create an application that prints "hello world" in a programming language.
- Create a Dockerfile for this application
- Build a Docker image from this Dockerfile
- Create and run a Docker container from this Docker image
- Interact with the container by entering (and gaining access with for example a shell) to the running Docker container
- Stop and remove the Docker container.
